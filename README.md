# Space-CV
Welcome to planet "CV-Ulixxess"

Year 3024. After the World War 6 humanity decided to leave the Earth. The most rich people - programmers, as they were called once, moved to their own planets to find the peace and build their own worlds.
You are the one of the last cosmic samurai's traveling through the space searching for the programmers to HIRE.

But be carefull, no one knows what waits for u in this unknown world...
